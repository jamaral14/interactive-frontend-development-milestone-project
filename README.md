## Mix or Match Doctor Memory(Game)  :ambulance:

# How do you play memory match game?

1. Mix up the cards.
2. Lay them in rows, face down.
3. Turn over any two cards.
4. If the two cards match, keep them.
5. If they don't match, turn them back over.
6. Remember what was on each card and where it was.
7. Watch and remember during the other player's turn.
8. The game is over when all the cards have been matched.
